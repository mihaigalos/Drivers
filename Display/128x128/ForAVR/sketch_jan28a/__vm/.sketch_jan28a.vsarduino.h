                visual micro and the arduino ide ignore this code during
   compilation. this code is automatically maintained by visualmicro, manual
   changes to this file will be overwritten
                the contents of the Visual Micro sketch sub folder can be
   deleted prior to publishing a project
                all non-arduino files created by visual micro and all visual
   studio project or solution files can be freely deleted and are not required
   to compile a sketch (do not delete your own code!).
                note: debugger breakpoints are stored in '.sln' or '.asln'
   files, knowledge of last uploaded breakpoints is stored in the
   upload.vmps.xml file. Both files are required to continue a previous debug
   session without needing to compile and upload again

        Hardware: Mihai ATmega328p, Platform=avr, Package=arduino
